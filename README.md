# discord-verification

Simple verification system I made using djs, express and request. 

## Prerequisites

- Discord Application
- A Guild
- Google reCAPTCHA v2 API keys

## Setup

Firstly, install all the dependencies by doing 
```
npm install
```
Next, open template_config.json and fill out all the data. 
### Put the public google API key into html/captcha.html at data-sitekey

If you've set it up all correctly run npm start and it will run.
